These files were generated by the [glad2](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) OpenGL loader generator and have been checked in as-is. You can re-generate them using glad with the following command:

```
python -m glad --profile core --out-path glad/ --api "gl=4.3,gles2=3.2" --generator=c
```

You can also generate the source using [this site](https://gen.glad.sh/):
1. Select '4.3' for GL, '3.2' for GLES2, and 'Core' for Profile.
2. Under options, select 'merge'.
3. Input the currently supported extensions from [here](https://github.com/rtiangha/bravely-offline-citra/blob/master/externals/glad/include/glad/gl.h#L23), plus any new required extensions.
4. Click Generate and download the generated source zip.
5. Unzip the new source over the current glad source files.
